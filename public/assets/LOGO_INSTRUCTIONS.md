# How to Add Your Company Logo

## Current Setup
- The application now uses `logo.svg` for the company logo
- All references have been updated from "AutoCRM" to "AutoConnect"
- A placeholder logo has been created at `assets/logo.svg`

## To Add Your Own Logo:

### Option 1: Replace the SVG file
1. Save your company logo as `logo.svg` in the `assets/` folder
2. Make sure it's sized appropriately (40x40px recommended)
3. The logo will automatically appear across all pages

### Option 2: Use a different format (PNG/JPG)
1. Save your logo as `logo.png` or `logo.jpg` in the `assets/` folder
2. Update all HTML files to change `logo.svg` to `logo.png` (or your format)
3. Files to update:
   - customers.html
   - dashboard.html
   - deals.html
   - index.html
   - inventory.html
   - leads.html
   - reports.html
   - settings.html
   - tasks.html

### Logo Requirements:
- **Size**: 40x40 pixels (or maintain aspect ratio)
- **Format**: SVG (preferred), PNG, or JPG
- **Background**: Transparent (for SVG/PNG) works best
- **Colors**: Should work well on dark sidebar background

### Current Logo Location:
All logos appear in the sidebar header next to "AutoConnect"

## Company Name Changes Made:
✅ All page titles updated to "AutoConnect"
✅ All sidebar headers updated to "AutoConnect"  
✅ Login page updated to "AutoConnect"
✅ All logo alt text updated to "AutoConnect Logo"

The application is now fully branded as "AutoConnect" and ready for your custom logo!
